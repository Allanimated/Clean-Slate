# Clean Slate CLI Application

Clean Slate is a command-line interface (CLI) cleaning management system powered by SQLAlchemy. Clients authenticate through login/signup, gaining access to a variety of services. After selecting a service by inputting the task ID, they receive a confirmation, notifying them that the service has been booked successfully. The message includes the assigned cleaner's name and a promise of their arrival within the next hour. "Thank you for choosing Clean Slate." Streamline your cleaning tasks effortlessly with Clean Slate CLI.
